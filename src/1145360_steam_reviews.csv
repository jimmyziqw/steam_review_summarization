"So, I actually have a lot more play time in Hades than shown on Steam, because I originally bought it on Switch. It's a better experience on Steam because Xbox One controller > Joy-Cons. I bought it on sale on Steam to support these game makers even further, because they made a bonafide masterpiece when they made Hades.

This isn't going to be a very detailed review. Hades looks fantastic, sounds even better, and plays with the energy of an isometric DOOM game. You play as Zagreus, son of Hades, whose goal is to escape the Underworld, uncovering mysteries, meeting distinct, well-defined characters, and tearing up the scenery along the way. The game unfolds in such an elegant, natural way. The house of Hades seems to expand every time you ""die"" and return home, there's an ever-expanding codex to learn more info about the game's characters, enemies, and items, and the feeling of progression just seems to continue for a huge length of time, well past what I would expect. That strengthens the feeling that the game just doesn't get old or stop being fun.

"(Spoilers may be ahead) Honestly, this game is fucking amazing. Everything about it from the art, to the game-play, to the story, it all just feels amazing. The game is beautiful with asphodel looking like the perfect incarnation of traditional hell and the surface/Greece looking amazing. All of the characters have great stories and are incredibly helpful (obviously except from Hades) with my personal favourite character of ,Hades, since, while he obviously tries to stop you leaving (both minions [spoiler]and himself[/spoiler]) he does still love you [spoiler]and Persephone[/spoiler] and I love how subtle his changes are [spoiler]up until when Persephone comes home[/spoiler]. Now then, the game-play. The fucking game-play. I can't say much about it because it's hard to describe without playing yourself but I'm gonna try. Most of the weapons in the game feel great to use as for example the sword actually feels impactful when swinging it around at all the monsters, while the shield giving knockback when blocking damage makes it feel realistic and all the better when you charge at the enemy's yourself. Overall, this game is fucking phenomenal, 10/10, 5 stars, would gladly erase my memory of this game to experience it again for the first time.",1649756916,True,0,0,0,0

"It's been a while since my first run-through (over a year now), but I think I remember it taking me 30-40 hours to clear it the first time. However, you get much more than 40 hours of game play for the twenty-five dollar price. The magic with Hades is that even after unlocking everything and beating it, it's still incredibly fun to play and tons to do. You can try a variety of different builds to escape hell as well as accomplish side quests while continuing to build relationships with the characters. Along with the beautiful soundtrack and graphics, the ability to be creative with each run makes it engaging, as well as being able to fine-tune the difficulty level and decide for yourself what challenges you'd like to overcome. 

A fun little thing to do once you've completed the game: search up the voice actors for each character. I gained a newfound appreciation for them and their range, as several actors voice characters that sound completely different from each other. I'm not surprised that this game was hailed as one of 2020's best games of the year.

A great feedback loop through combat, combined with a multitude of godly boons and weapon combos and almost no two runs will be the same.

"An absolutely addictive and fantastic game. Though I've clocked >500 hours on it at this point, I probably clocked 100 of them in just the first month I played in Early Access. I wore permanent fingertip-shaped grooves in my keyboard cover. My arm was pretty displeased with me back then, but it was worth it. And I'm way overdue for writing a review on this game.

[b]Characters:[/b] There isn't a single character I don't like in this game. Even good ol' Theseus is written in a way where you love to ""hate"" him. Zagreus is a great main character with an excellent balance of humor, compassion, and determination as he blazes his way through the Underworld and meets a host of interesting beings along the way. The gods and goddesses are all written with strikingly unique personalities while still maintaining that common thread that these are powerful beings with a lot of pride, and they will smite you should you slight them. Then there's your allies along the way, including those at home and a unique character in each part of the Underworld to give you moral support and a boost or item. [spoiler]Bouldy is the best boulder of all time.[/spoiler]

[b]Relationships:[/b] Many of Zagreus's most important relationships, whether familial or otherwise, have a rather rocky start to them, and it's a delight to see him develop together with the other characters to come to an understanding, forming an even stronger bond out of all the adversity. It's also very nice that Zagreus can pick whether he has a platonic or romantic relationship with certain characters, and the game allows him to have a male love interest, a female love interest, or both! Zagreus shows what a big heart he has through repairing others' relationships as well, and it's lovely to see second chances work out.

[b]Plot:[/b] While the main gist of the story may seem obvious from the get-go (in other words, escaping the Underworld), there are still surprises to be had along the way and at the end. Without going into spoiler territory, there is certainly more in store than one might think. Plus, what's enjoyable about this game isn't just the main plot but every subplot woven expertly through it. There are plenty of fun quests to execute and character developments to get invested in advancing. It'll keep you hooked.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] There's a bit of a learning curve, but soon you'll find yourself getting into the swing of all the different Boons (power-ups) you can get from the pantheon. Every god/dess can add their own unique flair to your basic moves, whether that's more power, status effects, or something else. The variety is delightful, making each run unique, and you'll have fun testing out different combos. There are six different main weapons as well, each with four different Aspects (versions), for even more mixing and matching when you unlock them. It may seem like a lot at first, but you'll soon find yourself memorizing everything from sheer experience. There's a lot of different enemies to beat, but get used to their patterns and you'll succeed. Put enough time into the game and you might find that playing a run even becomes a way to de-stress, or at least it did for me.

[b]Music:[/b] Wonderful. Darren Korb is as incredible as always. You'll find the game's music stuck in your head, and it really lends a great atmosphere while you're playing. I sing along wholeheartedly to the songs with lyrics. You can unlock songs in the game, but I also highly recommend the soundtrack. And let's not forget the music played in-game by Zagreus himself, if he perseveres through enough practice. He's no prodigy, but it adds fun flavor.

[b]Art:[/b] Stunning. Jen Zee does not disappoint. The unique, colorful style of the game just pops, very eye-catching. Every part of the underworld has its own cool aesthetic, and you can add to it yourself as well by purchasing certain renovations. And of course, all of the characters have spectacular detailed designs that stand out from each other, showing that beauty isn't limited to appearing any specific way.

[b]Other:[/b] As if all the big main components of this game weren't amazing enough, it's all the little things that add up to this truly remarkable experience as well. I died after a long streak of successful runs, which of course was disappointing, and one of the characters commented on it and encouraged Zagreus. The fact that there's a Supportive Shade in Elysium is just so cute, and I definitely acknowledge them every time, just as I pet Cerberus after every run. Yes, you can pet the good boy, the real mark of an excellent game. I am so terribly glad [spoiler]that they didn't make us fight the dog, the possibility of which seriously scared me the first time I got up to Styx and saw him.[/spoiler] 

I have recommended this game to many of my friends, and every single one of them has enjoyed it, too. I'm seriously impressed that Supergiant Games managed to craft something so masterful, something which tied up the plot points and character developments enough that you could feel satisfied having completed it and yet something so fun and enticing that you keep coming back to play more anyway.

If you find it difficult, turn on God Mode immediately. It only helps a bit in the beginning but grows with each failure, so the earlier you turn it on the faster it can assist you. Also looking up good builds can dramatically increase your power.",1649607517,True,0,0,0,0

"This game is incredible. I never thought I would enjoy a rogue-like, but after seeing all the awards it won and how cheap it was on sale, I had to give it a shot.

The art, music, and quality of voice acting are off the charts. It's astounding that there's very little repeated dialog. You can tell this game was made by very passionate people. It's very refreshing to see so much love and care go into a game instead of the rushed crap many AAA game studios are pushing out.

As for combat, this has a very fresh and fun take. Each god generally has one or two ways to buff each of your three attacks, called ""boons"". Each god offers additional boons that further expand on the attack boons. For example, Poseidon makes your attacks knock enemies away. There's another Poseidon boon called ""Razor Shoals"" where if you knock an enemy away, that enemy takes damage if it moves. Additionally, there's ""duo boons"" that can only be unlocked if you have specific attack boons from specific gods. So if you pick 2-3 gods and focus on them, you get some very strong combinations and a very unique combat style for that run, which keeps this game fresh for a very long time.

I highly recommend this game, it's been a blast. When I came across the end credits, I thought, ""oh neat. That was fun. Can I keep going? I still have a lot I want to get done."" And it lets you keep going! At this time of writing, I'm almost to the epilogue. I'm hoping to 100% this game, which I've never had the patience to do with any other game before.",1649595516,True,0,0,0,0

I'm not normally into rogue-like/lite games, but boy am I glad to have been able to try out this one. If having to replay same levels over and over again inescapably makes you feel like a hamster trapped in a wheel, this game will make you feel like a hamster who purchased a fancy exercise wheel that tastefully accompanies you on your rodent fitness journey with clever and entertaining motivational messages while dispensing healthy gourmet treats at appropriate intervals. [Holy cognitive re-framing, Batman!]

Strange metaphors aside, the game is indeed an audio and visual treat. Beautiful art concept with plenty of adorable little details to pay attention to, like the emote reactions of random shades (which btw I really wish they'd made available as Steam emoticons) or tiny candles being blown out by your attacks.
Many times, particularly at the start, I had to just stop and admire the decor or observe random background events that have no impact on the gameplay or story - Hades doing administrative work, Dusa and Meg gossiping on a girls' night out, random shades talking about the often ironic circumstances of their demise.
You've probably already heard that the music is amazing, and it really is great, from background battle sequences to vocal tracks. And the voice acting... wow! Every character is memorable, every dialogue is enjoyable. Including that one (quite important) character who basically speaks zombie. Also, mad props to whoever voiced Tisiphone... I actually got really curious to hear what she'll have to say every time I was about to meet her (more like 'how' rather that 'what', hard to explain without spoiling the encounter for new players), & I have to say, the er... character development was an amusing surprise.

The story is a tongue-in-cheek modernized take on a certain Greek myth, with a corporate twist. It's very well written, entertaining and at a certain point even emotional. I don't know if they made a gazillion recordings or if the lines are so well randomized, maybe it's both, but I barely noticed any repetition. Even after I finished the game, all achievements included, I still encounter lines that I haven't heard before here and there, and there's always something to make me chuckle.

Gameplay-wise, it's usually pretty easy to figure out the best tactics for each weapon. No rocket science. Except maybe when you get a certain ancient Greek weapon  The rewards system encourages you to switch it up and rotate your weaponry each escape attempt. Controls are simple, minimal finger nimbleness required. You'll receive random power-ups on your way, and while you will acquire limited tools to re-roll certain choices, you'll mostly be at the mercy of the Fates, i.e. RNG. In terms of play style, you can try going more in-depth by doing a bit of wiki diving and pre-planning your build, or you can just pick whatever seems good enough in the moment. I've been able to successfully escape with both approaches, so... you're free to do as you may. :)

Lots of love and talent was put into this game, and it was an absolute delight to come back to, over and over again, for a few achievement-grinding laps in Hell.

I was having tons of fun up till I had to fight the guardian of the Temple of Styx, which made me seriously consider stopping the game there and then. Then.. relief. And every run after I started looking forward to seeing him get vanquished and destroyed again and again...

I'm not really into rogue-lite games, but redoing each level in Hades provides a different refreshing experience. The storyline is entwined with the grind, slowly revealing bits and pieces as you get on with the grind. The combat is sharp, consistent and reactive, with the symphony of weapons and godly boons allowing for a myriad of tactics. Even throughout each new run, it never gets dull with Zag's stash of snarky quips and his interactions with the scornful Hades, the prickly Artemis, the flirty Aphrodite, the lovelorn Orpheus and everyone else.

Just get this game. You get to pet best companion Cerberus.

This might be a perfect game. It's impeccably polished and can automatically tune itself to any skill level; the story feels engaging and nicely rewards prior knowledge of Greek mythology; the art direction couldn't be better; and the soundtrack ABSOLUTELY SLAPS ‚Äì man, I'd listen to Darren Korb just play with his car keys, y'know?

Neither I like such arcade games, nor am I fan of rogue-like genre.
Yet overwhelmingly positive feedback reviews had convinced me.

Gameplay-wise the game is more or less what I expected.
The reason why people love it, is because the game actually reacts to EACH attempt (no exaggeration). Mainly via the NPC conversations, but also the change in the game world.

Such thorough though of the developers made the game based on constant repeats very alive. And as such, it's more interesting to try again, even if you fail. Because the story always goes on and on regardless!

Anyway, after 14h I finally broke free, and that's enough from me. There are still many more hours of gameplay left for those who's interested in the story, there are many more things left unopened.

"Just a well honed game in all facets; visual style, character design/writing, gameplay loop, the voice acting, the music, different weapons. At most every step, you can tell the studio took the time to consider how it impacted the player. Dying on a run isnt the worst because there's something new at the base camp, maybe tweak your build a bit, make a talent a bit stronger. With how you can manage your run with trinket choice, the different mirror status choices, there's a way to guide your build will turn out if you want some control, but just as importantly, if embracing the chaos of the run is more your style, theres trinkets and options for you. There's options for if the gameplay is too punishing but seeing how the story turns out is more important to you.  If you're just stepping into the roguelite genre, Hades is an excellent first recommendation.  Its absolutely in my top 10 games of the last 10 years.

"I'm not much for a roguelike game, but this is a nice surprise


When you begin the game you are shown a simple roguelike game, but as the game progresses you should see and hear, the art and music of this game are exceptional. There are various Arts for each character and all animations are really well made, there is a great variation of music and it's really great and fitting for each occasion.

You have various different ways to play and the gameplay is real extensive, you would think you are tired after 15+ times of trying to go through different dungeons but even after you reach some objectives, you still find new ways to play.

The Story is real deep and amazingly there is voice lines to every single comment on this game, and trust me, there is A LOT of different comments in this game. There are about 30 characters with a relationship between themselves(greek gods being all a big family and all) and this game really gives the feeling that everyone knows each other and sometimes you get a backstory from a character from another one's perspective.

"8/10 gameplay is a standard Rouge-lite, it does have some good upgrades to weapons and challenges that make the repetition of areas last longer. However you are really coming for the story which is expertly written. Tying narrative to gameplay will always be the shit.

Fighting the bosses, the end boss and finally betting them you end up realizing... well now I have to do it again! There is more story here! You beat that segment and then you realize... well damn I still have a bunch of stuff locked that requires more story and gameplay.

Story can be a tad...cringy in few moments and interractions but in general all characters are well executed and voiced over.

Main downfalls :

Locations will always be the same and in the same order.

Some weapons are vastly better than the others.

Artstyle is neat, with dashes of colour very fitting for the game.

"As you can see, I have around 100 hours sunk into the game at the moment of this review and...I've still not heard a single line of dialogue twice. Considering the repetitive nature of the game and also that almost half of those hours belong to a time where the game wasn't fully fleshed out, it's quite impressive. And yeah, I said ""heard"", because it's fully dubbed.

Supergiant clearly does this hustle out of passion, previous works are just a testament of that (Transistor or Pyre share the same level of quality and care in the making) so, I have no doubt in mind that they do this with passion coming first above everything else, instead of seeking just for lucrative business opportunities.

In the end, the bare bones of any game should be the gameplay in itself, right? What if we don't even take that in consideration and we just have a look at everything else? The music, the voice acting, the lore or the art style, without having to to delve further into every one of them, can easily stand out on their own, but here, we have a very strong game into the ""videogame"" as well, and it's addicting. The combat system is satisfying and rewarding, a mixture of action and dialogues with the classic rogue-lite features, such as the progression system and, in Hades case, a particularly rich story that unfolds run after run in a very muscle oriented Greek Gods Pantheon.

All in all I'm just glad that Supergiant finally got the recognition it deserves after some time...now I'm just excited to see what they've got stored for us next...so, yeah, do consider on taking a dive in their latest and most ambitious effort so far, it's worth it, both money and time!",1649083781,True,0,0,0,0

There just isn't enough level or weapon variety for this to be a 200h+ game like Isaac or Dead Cells. And that's totally fine - Hades is an incredible bargain as it is, and there's plenty to do.

Hades is a fantastic roguelike action game. For little over 20‚Ç¨ the amount of content you get is astounding... the story, characters, visuals and soundtrack are the game's strongest selling point, I enjoyed every second of the journey Hades offered me despite failing often, which is to be expected from these type of games. Only downside of this game is that it quickly becomes grindy and repetitive, which I know is the main feature of roguelike titles... that's the only ‚Äò‚Äôbad thing‚Äô‚Äô I can think of. Supergiant Games truly delivered us a masterpiece which i recommend to everyone.

I'm not really into rogue-lite games, but redoing each level in Hades provides a different refreshing experience. The storyline is entwined with the grind, slowly revealing bits and pieces as you get on with the grind. The combat is sharp, consistent and reactive, with the symphony of weapons and godly boons allowing for a myriad of tactics. Even throughout each new run, it never gets dull with Zag's stash of snarky quips and his interactions with the scornful Hades, the prickly Artemis, the flirty Aphrodite, the lovelorn Orpheus and everyone else.

"It is a good game, lots of fun, big part of the battle/weapon system came from Bastion so if you like it you will like this game too.
But please stop calling it a roguelike - it is a rogueLITE. With all the unlockables making the game easier and easier, this is very different from roguelikes where the takeaway from each death is 99% experience, players can't totally rely on unlockables to advance further. Think about The Binding of Isaac, new items are added into a pool of hundreds of items that you can't bet on that to show up in order to clear the game, character upgrades are extremely hard to unlock and the upgrades are only good to the seasoned players who understand how to use it. The only reliable way to advance is get better at the game, learn how to dodge bullets, memorize monster attack patterns and item effects. If you are that bad you have died 100 times in a row on the first floor, the game still won't show you any mercy, this is roguelike. But Hades? You are literally getting all sorts of currencies from every room you've cleared to unlock any power-ups you like...it might be hard for some people, Z's death is inevitable for most of us, but he is following a very steady development curve and it is more about time than skills.

"It is very easy to write a review for Hades. It is a must-play masterpiece. I started it at launch. Cross-save with the Switch came a bit later and it is the greatest, giving the option to play where and how you like. My favorite way to play is on Steam in 4K hooked up to my sound system with the incredible soundtrack blasting. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the gameplay, the story, the human touch of the game, and absolutely incredible music. This game is as good as it gets.
There are songs and characters that have such depth and emotion it is astonishing. There are beautiful heart-rending songs, and there are absolute rocking songs. And the gameplay loop and progression and voice acting are packed with enjoyment. This game is bursting with value and quality. I enjoy every weapon. I got furthest with the power gloves. I love the rhythm of those things. The shield is also a favorite, (and I never choose ‚Äúthe shield‚Äù in a game). This shield in Hades is awesome.
In summary this game is worthy of the highest praises of gaming in 2020, and to me is the beacon of hope that gaming can remain high quality with one-time purchases of complete games without micro transactions and online requirements and gimmicky practices. This is pure and simply a value-packed, complete gaming experience with much passion poured in to it. Well done Greg Kasavin and team. Back in the day you (Greg) were the greatest reviewer of games at GameSpot and I‚Äôve never trusted a reviewer of games or had more fun learning about games than anyone since your days reviewing games.

"I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. Usually, when I play roguelikes/lites, I won't get very far into it. Maybe I'll enjoy the game for a couple few hours only reaching the 2nd or 3rd or so area and then promptly giving up. I was very close to doing the same with Hades.

However, eventually I found myself beating the final boss, and then beat it again couple more times to unlock the true ending finishing off at 42 attempts and clocking in around 30+ hours. I then realize I've only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer and still have a lot of stuff to unlock and beat. But that doesn't bother me because the game is just that fun! 

The gameplay loop  of battling enemies, getting boons from the Greek gods, beating bosses, and then dying over and over again is highly addicting. Trying out different builds with different weapons is such a treat and makes sure no run is ever the same. What really ties the whole experience for me though, is the plot and the amazing characters and the relationships you build with them. Dying in this rougelite doesn't feel bad, because you get to interact with these characters again and slowly get to know them through crumbs of dialogue each time you die and go back to the starting area. I can't help but love the game even more for its amazing art direction and soundtrack too which just enhances an already good experience to an amazing one.

While I may have already beaten this game, I'll definitely be continuing to play it to unlock more on what's on offer and get all the achievements. Possibly even replay this in the future! This may be one of the best game this decade.",1648820986,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2

There is nothing like Hades.

Supergiant Games made Hades without crunch. It has dozens of hours of meaningful content. Its' easy mode is one of the more clever ways of addressing difficult. It runs well. The narrative has quality representation. And it's one the best video games I have played in a long long time.

"I have no patience for games that are difficult just for the sake of being difficult. As such, I was wary on buying this, but I'm glad I did. First of all trial and error isn't that harsh in this game. For example, you don't have to memorize what every god can give you since you can unlock codex that you can check any time. And there's a lot of freedom in your build, the RNG has a habit of maybe not giving you exactly what you need, but giving something you can still work with.

Secondly there's God mode, which you can turn on and off at will. It simply gives you 20% damage resistance upfront, with extra 2% each time you die. Which in practice isn't that much since most enemies will do like 1-20 damage, and yet it still feels comforting to see that 2% up when you die. Instead of punishing you after death (like taking away half of your health), it rewards you for your resilience. It takes away some of the bitterness of failure, giving you a small push to keep moving forward because you're literally getting stronger.

"This game truly is a work of art. More accurately, it's the confluence of several pieces of art, each united in a brilliant plot that kept me driven to find out more of it.

In more detail, it's got excellent and satisfying gameplay that has enough replayability to help you get your money's worth. It's got a mixture of the classic ""get the big number bigger, funny bad guys go boom"" feel, with enough nuance to make you think.

The plot is very well written in my opinion, and I've been described as hard-to-please before, so please take that as quite high praise. It's pretty clear to me that the developers have really done their homework when it comes to the Greek Mythology side of things. I won't pretend to be an expert on the subject, but my not non-existent knowledge was quite easily surpassed by the game's depth.

Now on to perhaps my favourite part of this game, the atmosphere, that is more specifically, the music and artwork. I really do mean artwork in every sense of its meaning when I say that as well, each model and effect has a beautiful art-style that flows wonderfully together. The game's very colourful and exceptionally good to simply look at. The music is another thing entirely. I've sat in areas I've cleared out just to sit and bop to the background music, and then listening to it crescendo again when I go back into combat seamlessly.

10/10 

Deserved to be GOTY 2020.

Pros:
Legendary story
Memorable cast
Entertaining and unique dialogue pool that can be influenced by your own actions
Meme worthy music
High replay value after the main story is finished [spoiler]That includes after bringing back Persephone. Don't get fooled by the credits.[/spoiler]
Enjoyable gameplay that doesn't feel repetitive as no build is 100% similar
Vibrant art and environments
Has a flexible difficulty curve making it enjoyable for both the casual and hardcore

Cons:
Dialogue and plot progression is a pain to get through due to RNGesus even if you have finished all the requirements beforehand.
Some characters at times can only be talked to or gifted. Never both.
Post-game cosmetics are a massive grind fest. After clearing Heat 16 and beyond with each weapon, you would've already experienced at least 90% of what the game has to offer.
RNGesus isn't offering his boons in this game. Getting that Legendary or Duo boon to complete your build is a gamble even with the help you are getting. If you get unlucky, kiss your escape goodbye.
Sharp reflexes with good pattern recognition is still needed. All the boons in existence cannot compensate for your own incompetency. Turn-based players be warned.

"I initially played this game as part of the Xbox Live games they had. So don't be fooled. The number of hours I have on this game is probably +80 hours of what I have on steam, as I had already ""beaten"" the game before I got it on steam.

As someone who has never played a roguelike before Hades, I can say that this game has everything!

- Great gameplay and combat with various weapons and boons, as well as some randomization with regards to levels to make each run unique and keep things fresh.
- Game looks amazing and the characters and enviorment are easy on the eyes.
- Amazing music to pump you up during the action segments, and beautiful calm music during some of the rest stops, and before you start your run. You sometimes just can't help yourself but take a breather and just calmly listen to the music while also admiring the scenarie.
- Fun, challenging and memorable bosses.

- And the glue that keeps it all together is the story and writing of this game. Sometimes you just want to want your run to end prematurely so that you can go back and talk to the characters at the beginning. So, each time you die, you don't really feel frustrated maybe except for the initial second of shock, but then you are ready to go back out again. After having talked with all the characters first of course (which is optional, but IMO is argueably the best part of the game, so why would you?).


Each run is also not that long depending on how far you get, so you almost always have time for a run or 2, and you can even quit midway, and it will continue where you left off. So don't be scared off by the length of the game!

"I'm not normally into rogue-like/lite games, but boy am I glad to have been able to try out this one. If having to replay same levels over and over again inescapably makes you feel like a hamster trapped in a wheel, this game will make you feel like a hamster who purchased a fancy exercise wheel that tastefully accompanies you on your rodent fitness journey with clever and entertaining motivational messages while dispensing healthy gourmet treats at appropriate intervals. [Holy cognitive re-framing, Batman!]

Strange metaphors aside, the game is indeed an audio and visual treat. Beautiful art concept with plenty of adorable little details to pay attention to, like the emote reactions of random shades (which btw I really wish they'd made available as Steam emoticons) or tiny candles being blown out by your attacks.
Many times, particularly at the start, I had to just stop and admire the decor or observe random background events that have no impact on the gameplay or story - Hades doing administrative work, Dusa and Meg gossiping on a girls' night out, random shades talking about the often ironic circumstances of their demise.
You've probably already heard that the music is amazing, and it really is great, from background battle sequences to vocal tracks. And the voice acting... wow! Every character is memorable, every dialogue is enjoyable. Including that one (quite important) character who basically speaks zombie. Also, mad props to whoever voiced Tisiphone... I actually got really curious to hear what she'll have to say every time I was about to meet her (more like 'how' rather that 'what', hard to explain without spoiling the encounter for new players), & I have to say, the er... character development was an amusing surprise.

The story is a tongue-in-cheek modernized take on a certain Greek myth, with a corporate twist. It's very well written, entertaining and at a certain point even emotional. I don't know if they made a gazillion recordings or if the lines are so well randomized, maybe it's both, but I barely noticed any repetition. Even after I finished the game, all achievements included, I still encounter lines that I haven't heard before here and there, and there's always something to make me chuckle.

Gameplay-wise, it's usually pretty easy to figure out the best tactics for each weapon. No rocket science. Except maybe when you get a certain ancient Greek weapon [spoiler]a.k.a. the gun with an under-barrel grenade launcher. :)[/spoiler] The rewards system encourages you to switch it up and rotate your weaponry each escape attempt. Controls are simple, minimal finger nimbleness required. You'll receive random power-ups on your way, and while you will acquire limited tools to re-roll certain choices, you'll mostly be at the mercy of the Fates, i.e. RNG. In terms of play style, you can try going more in-depth by doing a bit of wiki diving and pre-planning your build, or you can just pick whatever seems good enough in the moment. I've been able to successfully escape with both approaches, so... you're free to do as you may. :)

Lots of love and talent was put into this game, and it was an absolute delight to come back to, over and over again, for a few achievement-grinding laps in Hell.",1648525293,True,60,3,0.833817780017852783,0

"Hades ties the main story to the game progression beautifully. 

For any new players out there, my advice is: Don't look anything up. You don't need any guides or tips before you get at least 50 runs in, since the game will introduce new mechanics to you as you progress, and you'll naturally get further without needing to optimize your gameplay. Enjoy the ride and explore wacky, suboptimal builds - there's no benefit from limiting your strategies from the start.

I was initially put off by the idea of essentially needing to grind resources to level skills at the Mirror, but now I see that the execution was brilliant. It allows for a sense of progression as the player gets better at the game alongside Mirror upgrades, while the story is gradually revealed to the player.

My only gripe with the game is that [spoiler] you can't visit Persephone's garden after she returns to the Underworld. I liked that place - it should at least be an infrequent, random occurrence (say, 1/20) instead of only getting the dead scene. [/spoiler]",1648491361,True,0,0,0,0

Gameplay- 6 very Different weapons (one being a gun) with each having 4 variations for each weapon. fast paced, dodge based combat. very hard at the start but lowers in difficulty as you progress with upgrades until you finish your first run. where you decide the difficulty there on, which helps immensely in its replayability and its storytelling.

Design/artsyle- striking artsyle+very intriguing designs for gods and bosses. However normal enemies designs not so much. backgrounds and environment look great

Music- just listen to it. if the composer for the game says it 'Mediterranean Prog-Rock Halloween' style then it is at the very least interesting and most would call a BOP

Price- very cheap for the amount of quantity, quality and replayability of the game.

"I've had a lot of fun playing Hades!
Essentially the goal of the game is to escape from hell, using random gifts from Greek Gods to make you stronger as you progress. At first you'll probably be dying a lot, but you get to take back the treasure you picked up and use it to gradually make yourself stronger, unlocking more weapons, buffs and letting the story unfold. I think what this game does better than Isaac or Dead Cells is that no run feels totally wasted, you always have something to bring back even from a terrible escape attempt and there's always some sort of plot point expanded upon which helps keep things from going stale.
I'm still working through a lot of the story elements even now, the characters are all wonderful in their own ways and despite having vast amounts of dialogue everything's fully voice acted. I am just floored by how far I've come and still getting to hear new dialogue every single time, this game just went all out with the presentation.
If I could pick one thing I think was comparatively disappointing, I'd say it's the lack of locations. It's always the exact same number of rooms per zone with only four locales in total in the same order every time. It would have been nice if there were branching paths for different zones like other games of this type. Also a small nitpick but sometimes each room can be rather large and occasionally there are urns that hold currency, it's a pain to scour each room checking to make sure you didn't miss it and I wish they'd put them next to the exits instead.

"A fine masterpiece by Supergiant Games.
I really liked Transistor and its play style so naturally I bought this game. My first play through was cool. Nothing special. Died before reaching Meg. Played 2-3 more times and was a bit disappointed since I can't choose the upgrades(boons) I want like in Transistor. But slowly I realised that's also exactly why this game is amazing. In each play through, you're blessed with different boons from different Gods. Its random (but not totally random - It won't give u boon to enhance deflect skills if u don't have any deflect skill). Every play through feels unique because of this. You can have so many different boon effects stacked up to make your attack/alternate attack/cast/dodge/all of them more powerful. The possibilities are so much.
The game evolves and the story moves forward after every play through. You also become permanently stronger with the loot from play through. Slight warning - Getting to the end of the story will take a lot of time.
The artwork and music is really impressive. Every screen is much more content rich. Looking back at Transistor, that game really looks shallow now.
Only downside is it doesn't have an impressive background at main menu. :(",1648055299,True,1,0,0,0

"I'd seen this game in my recommended store feed for quite some time and always wondered 'why'.  Didn't look like something I'd enjoy.

A friend bought me it for my B'day and I gave it a play, because it would have been rude not to.  

Wow.  What a game!  Extremely simple concept, simple to learn/get going with... but with enough variety and possibilities for build (there has to be thousands, if not 10s of...) to keep each run different enough to make repeat runs interesting and engaging.  

I was constantly chasing an idea of a particular build, then when I didn't get the boons/upgrades I needed I was at first disheartened, only to discover the 'that'll have to do' perks choices opened up new and effective ways to beat the game.  

Then when I finally did beat it, there's a new mechanic to tweak/tailor the difficulty (increase it) in order to farm more items which are used for further weapon upgrades.   

This is a fun game, but fair disclosure... it's way to easy to find yourself playing well after you should be, responsibly, putting it down and maybe, sleeping, eating etc :)

"tl;dr: It's a great looking, addictive game with a fast-paced gameplay, great soundtrack, characters and dialogues! Worth the full price, so if you see a discount, it's an absolute must have!

For me personally, Hades is an overall example of how to captivate a player and don't let go. It wasn't long after I started playing that I realized that I had been looking for a game like this. The main reasons for this are:

1) [u][b]Keyboard and Mouse[/b][/u] friendly! I've play only with KB&M and except for rebinding the special attack to my mouse button, there was no limitation or disadvantage I could think of‚Ä¶
1) [u][b]""Boon"" system[/b][/u] and different weapons, which keeps the game reasonably fresh for most of the playthrough even if you want to complete everything
2) I would say its [u][b]difficulty[/b][/u] is great as it's not hard to get through all the bosses within first hours/days (depending on your gaming experience and commitment), but then additional challenges become available which can make your life difficult very quickly
3) [u][b]World design & artwork[/b][/u] is amazing and it's easy to fall in love with everything even if you don't know much about the Greek mythology*
4) [u][b]Soundtrack[/b][/u] which you encounter throughout the game is all it needs to be and a bit extra. There are moments in the game where most players just stop for a moment to appreciate everything the game has to offer

Something I also truly appreciate in a game like this are the dialogues. I have no idea how long it took to write and then dub everything, but if someone told me it took years, I would believe it. Not only there are friendly, serious and hostile interactions of the main character with everyone, but there are interactions between all the other character as well, which is another reason why it's nearly impossible to get bored in this game. And some interactions are pretty funny :)

*
[u][b]One recommendation for people, who don't know much about the mythology:[/b][/u]
If you can, play this game with someone, who can explain all the easter eggs and references, because playing with my partner who is obsessed with the Greek mythology since their childhood is what made my love for this game into an obsession. Pretty much everything makes sense and is surprisingly accurate (except for a few understandable details), so understanding the relations and symbolism in this game can actually translate into some fun knowledge of the real mythology. And all that while playing an awesome game! Also, it makes the interactions funnier :)",1648029358,True,0,0,0,0

The steady progression from dying to the first boss constantly, to getting to the next area and getting stuck there, until finally you're completing runs more often than not. And even once the credits roll, there's still plenty left to experience if you're a completionist. If you want to know how much, I still have quite a few things to buy in the shop to upgrade Zagreus' home, and slowly improving my rank with the resource director. I highly recommend this game, it's one of my favorites of all time.",1648010970,True,0,0,0,0

"Every aspect of this game is done with perfection. 
The story revolves around Zagreus, a prince of the underworld and the son of Hades, trying to escape the domains of the underworld to reach the surface and rekindle the relationship of his long lost mother Persephone. The characters in this game are just fantastic with each of them being given a multitude of dialog and personality and being backed with some amazing voice acting. The story and the way that it is written is so well done as it manages to balance both progression and story telling perfectly as the player will be learning new information about the plot each time they attempt a run and return to the main hub area. 
The setting of the underworld is impressively diverse as each area hold its own kind of tonality and I would go as far as to say that it can be seen as it's own character as it also manages to tell the story through each floor you encounter. 
Visually, its absolutely gorgeous. Supergiant games have always had a unique art direction and i believe that this game brings out the best in that. The way each character, level, item, etc looks in this game is just incredible and it clearly stands out from both other indie games and previous Supergiant games titles. 
Highlighting that this is a Supergiant games production, the soundtrack and audio are once again such a pleasure to enjoy. The soundtrack is just filled with moments that best fit the game, from intense and exciting battles to calm friendly encounters. The audio is just perfect with pretty much anything aural related being top par. 
In terms of gameplay, this is a brilliant rogue-like experience. The combat that you have in game feels very smooth and  fitting for any style that you may choose. There are 6 weapons to choose from, all with their own move sets and i believe that the game balances them pretty fairly. The enemies are also pretty varied with each of them offering the player a new challenge to try and overcome. The boss fights are incredible as nearly all of them will have some change to them each time you do a new run. The boon system is really well done with the player being able to pick and choose what buffs they want to carry on into the run. Items that you obtain in the runs can be used for all sorts of things such as upgrading your Zagreus, unlocking both weapons and abilities, creating bonds with other characters in the game, renovating both the hub world and the arenas. This game offers a lot to players but never lack in any aspects that it provides.

It always feels like there is something new to discover in and out of the house even beyond death. Giving this the setting of Greek Myth already gives it a large cast of instantly recognisable characters, and even if you don't know much about Greek Myth the devs make sure to give little bits and pieces about said characters that builds upon their basis in Myth, while keeping it interesting for the game.

"The story and characters, so far, seem very well made and engaging but the level play is repetitive and grindy to the point of boredom, and frustration that progress just seems to stall. The handicap ""God Mode"" to assist with beating the game is inadequate and underwhelming, and not very useful. There is not a lot of strategy that can be employed due to the randomised encounters. The visual designs are rad, the voice casting and effects are excellent.

Overall, there just doesn't seem to be enough variety to hold my interest. I want a game I can succeed at and maybe even win, not a game of continuous disappointment and an abusive parent figure.",1647865922,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0

Hades is a stone-cold classic, brilliant storytelling and format, It took me 18 runs to reach the Minotaur and Champion battle in Elysium so far, I'm sure other more capable players got there way earlier, but nevertheless I've been unable to put the damn controller down, it's a hard game, but not frustrating, because every run Zagreus gets stronger, smarter, faster.

Absolutely get this game, even at original price. There's many things that Hades does right and it is just such a satisfying, stylish hell of a game (hehe get it).

Now, what are those things that Hades does right? Well...

Extremely simple yet fun combat
Gorgeous hand-drawn art and scenery
Amazing cast of characters that always have something new to say no matter how many hours you have
Simple yet charming plot
Perfect balance of difficulty vs. reward
Creative weapons, keepsakes, powers (called boons), and talents that pushes you to play differently each run
Hours of content that won't bore you
Great game balancing, making nothing too overpowered/underpowered
Stellar optimization, allowing even the weakest of systems to run this game properly

...and more!

With my 50+ hours on this game, I've had a blast the whole time. If you have a feeling you're gonna like fast-paced, rewarding combat; and endlessly killing your father; then this is the game for you.

"i received this game as a gift from a friend after putting it on my wishlist, and wow, this game did not disappoint. i've been a fan of the roguelite genre for a very long time, and this is one of the best i've ever seen.

first, let's talk about the gameplay. in the game you play as zagreus, prince of the underworld, using various blessings from the gods, various trinkets, and the 6 infernal arms to break free from various regions of your father's domains to reach the surface. each of the infernal arms plays very different to any of the others and each of them has 4 aspects if you bother to seek them all out, so the base gameplay has the potential to be very diverse. you can also modify these weapons and how you play them based on the boons and enchantments you get throughout the run, ensuring that no two runs are really alike in terms of gameplay. the combat is very well done and satisfying and easy to get into.

i've seen some comments saying that hades is a very polished overall game, but not a good contender in the roguelite genre, which i have to agree on. while, yes, no two runs are alike, the amount of variety in basically any other aspect of this game is quite limited. first of all, in adherence to mythology, there are only so many underworld regions you can play through in the game, and there are only so many boss versions you can fight against. variety in these comes from the rooms you choose and the boss versions you randomly encounter, which is certainly enough for most casual players here for the story, but if you want to play for the roguelite element, then you'd do best to expect diminishing returns from replaying. another gripe i have with the roguelite element is how the game handles difficulty. hades equates difficulty to taking away your advantages rather than giving you disadvantages and advantages you have to work your way around, which i don't think is good roguelite design. this makes the game harder, but it does not make you want to keep getting better and playing the harder modes, because it ceases to be fun at some point. contrast this with other roguelites like dead cells and you immediately see the difference; 20+ heat in hades is intense and engaging, while 5BC in dead cells is the same but also fun and fair. but for most players this is not an issue at all since it'll take most players a long, long time to get to heat of that level unless you choose to play just one weapon every run, which isn't very fun. 

the story centers around the theme of family and zagreus' journey to reunite his own, which is done through his runs through the underworld, meeting various gods of olympus and hades and deepening bonds with them to eventually be able to bring them all together. it's a tale that i personally wasn't too invested in since i wanted to play for the gameplay, but let's just say that it blends very well with the roguelite genre and it makes the player want to play again and again to see it through to completion. to this i say compliments to the devs for making a story based roguelite, which is a true rarity.

as most people know, the art in this game is absolutely phenomenal, and the consistent quality of voice lines and attention to detail continues to amaze me even after putting over 70 hours into the game. the various side quests you can do by helping out members of the court of hades is also very rewarding for players as anyone well-versed in greek mythology will understand the lore and significance of zagreus's actions. i guess what i'm trying to say here is that having some level of understanding of greek mythology is the cherry on top for this game. 

that's about it. you should definitely play this game even if you're not a pogchamp pro gamer (trademark) because like i mentioned earlier, this game is just an overall very well polished game that just happens to be a roguelite",1647611048,True,0,0,0,0

"Was worried at first that I'd get bored and wouldn't get my money's worth. I've now played 185 hours. Gameplay is fun and challenging, and feels amazing when you get in a flow state. The writing and dialogue is good humored while still being a compelling story with depth and nuance. The voice acting is inspired. The art is stunningly beautiful. The music is beautiful and gripping across the board. Stays fresh run after run. Absolutely recommend!",1647571802,True,0,0,0,0
